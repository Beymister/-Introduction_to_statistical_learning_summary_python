# Enroute to ML via Statistics
## Summary of the book- Introduction of Statistical Learning by Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Gareth M. James, Robert Tibshirani

Whenever someone ask me - "How to get started in data science?" then I ususally recommend the book- Introduction to Statistical learning, to learn the basics of statistics and ML models. 

The books qoutes- "This book is intended for anyone who is interested in using modern statistical methods for modeling and prediction from data. This group includes scientists, engineers, data analysts, or quants, but also less technical individuals with degrees in non-quantitative fields such as the social sciences or business. We expect that the reader will have had at least one elementary course in statistics."

If this is you but finding it difficult to get through the entire book then use this repo to get quick summary of most important concepts along with data and python code. It's a good way to learn python for data science also.

I recommend this book because- 

* It gives a modest introduction to statistics and mathematics behind the most used methods like-
    - Regressions- linear, higher order polynomial, logistics
    - classifications,
    - decision trees,
    - clustering,
    - unsupervised learning,
    - resampling
    - cross validation methods.
- It also provides with a lab section in statistical programming language, R, for each these methods at the end of each chapter.

It prepares you to understand the concepts as well as gives you enough examples in R to get you started with using these models on your own data. 
(And this repo gives the same in python so you are covered either way)

Few important concepts it doesn't touch at all-

- Time series data models
- Neural networks
- Deep learning
- Bayesian

**This repo will give you notebook for each chapter with concept summary, data & python code to practice. This is meant to give you quick headstart with most used statistical concepts with data and code to play with. For deeper understanding of any concept, I recommend getting back to the book or just google.**

*If find any issues or have doubts then put them under issues in the repo*
