# Statistical Machine Learning in Python

Whenever someone asks me “How to get started in data science?”, I usually recommend the book — [“Introduction to Statistical Learning by Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Gareth M. James, Robert Tibshirani”](https://www.ime.unicamp.br/~dias/Intoduction%20to%20Statistical%20Learning.pdf)
, to learn the basics of statistics and ML models.

So as part of my series, [Data science for analytical minds](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-science-for-analytical-minds-introduction-8900b8d2477f), onboarding people to this book for learning statistical and machine learning seemed like the right step.

To do this, I have summarised each chapter of the book as a [notebook](https://github.com/shilpa9a/Introduction_to_statistical_learning_Summary_Python/tree/master/notebook) with concept summary, data & python code to practice. So just clone the repo and get started!

### About the book:

> "This book is intended for anyone who is interested in using modern statistical methods for modeling and prediction from data. This group includes scientists, engineers, data analysts, or quants, but also less technical individuals with degrees in non-quantitative fields such as the social sciences or business. We expect that the reader will have had at least one elementary course in statistics."

I recommend this book because- 

It gives a modest introduction to statistics and mathematics behind the most used methods like-

- Regressions,
- classifications,
- decision trees,
- SVM,
- clustering,
- unsupervised learning,
- resampling,
- cross-validation methods,
- Dimension reduction methods.

It also provides with a lab section with examples for each these methods at the end of each chapter. It prepares you to understand the concepts as well as gives you enough examples in statistical programming language, R, to get you started with using these models on your own data. (And this repo gives the same in python, so you are covered either way!)


Few important concepts it doesn't touch at all-

- Time series data models
- Neural networks
- Deep learning
- Bayesian

This is an independent part of my blog series, Data science for analytical minds, especially for people from non-tech backgrounds like economics, statistics, mathematics, physics etc. Checkout its [introductory blog](https://medium.com/@Shilpa9a/statistical-machine-learning-in-python-b095d4af36dd) & [data quality & cleaning blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/dirty-data-quality-assessment-cleaning-measures-39efb90ad734). This is the 3rd part of the series focusing on statistics & ML basics.

This is meant to give you quick head start with most used statistical concepts with data and code to play with. For a deeper understanding of any concept, I recommend getting back to the book.

If you find any issues or have doubts, feel free to submit [issues](https://github.com/shilpa9a/Introduction_to_statistical_learning_Summary_Python/issues).
