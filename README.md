# Enroute to ML via Statistics
Whenever someone ask me this question- "How to get started in data science?" then I ususally recommend the book- Introduction to Statistical learning, to learn the basics of statistics and ML models. 

The books qoutes- "This book is intended for anyone who is interested in using modern statis-
tical methods for modeling and prediction from data. This group includes
scientists, engineers, data analysts, or quants, but also less technical indi-
viduals with degrees in non-quantitative fields such as the social sciences or
business. We expect that the reader will have had at least one elementary
course in statistics."

But I usually see people finding it difficult to get through the entire book so I thought why not summarise this book and also give the option to test some of their lab examples in python notebook, as book already gives you examples in R.

So I recommend this book because- 

- It gives a modest introduction to statistics and mathematics behind the most used methods like-
    - Regressions- linear, higher order polynomial, logistics
    - classifications,
    - decision trees,
    - clustering,
    - unsupervised learning,
    - resampling
    - cross validation methods.
- It also provides with a lab section in statistical programming language, R, for each these methods at the end of each chapter.

It prepares you to understand the concepts as well as gives you enough examples in R to get you started with using these models on your own data. 

Few important concepts it doesn't touch at all-

- Time series data models
- Neural networks
- Deep learning
- Bayesian

**This repo will give you notebook for each chapter with concept summary, data & python code to practice. This is meant to give you quick headstart with most used statistical concepts with data and code to play with. For deeper understanding of any concept, I recommend getting back to the book or ever explaining internet.**

*If find any issues or have doubts then do put it in issues in the repo*
