# Statistical Machine Learning in Python

Whenever someone asks me “How to get started in data science?”, I usually recommend the book 📕 — [Introduction to Statistical Learning by Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Gareth M. James, Robert Tibshirani](https://www.ime.unicamp.br/~dias/Intoduction%20to%20Statistical%20Learning.pdf), to learn the basics of statistics and Machine Learning models. 

We all are aware that statistics forms the backbone of data science techniques like prediction, clustering, estimation, etc. However, it is the 'how' part where we get stuck. The objective of this book and derived notebook is to marry the statistical concepts with real-life data science problem statements. Each chapter/concept begins with a real scenerio, like - "You are a consultant who needs to advice the best medium of advertising & budgets to increase the sale of a product, using the advertising data" and explains techniques and methods step by step as we solve through it. 

🤔 But how does it help you lean? Through its 💡 lab section! The book gives R code snippets to teach us various functions that will come in handy to analyze data, build models, and test them. 

This notebook is a concise version of the book with the code in Python instead of R. It is a part of my data science blog series, [Data science for analytical minds](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-science-for-analytical-minds-introduction-8900b8d2477f). If you are curious to learn the application of statistics in building models, this can be your go-to resource. 

Each chapter of the book as a [notebook](https://github.com/shilpa9a/Introduction_to_statistical_learning_Summary_Python/tree/master/notebook) with concept summary, data & python code to practice. So just clone the repo and get started!

### More about the book:

> "This book is intended for anyone who is interested in using modern statistical methods for modeling and prediction from data. This group includes scientists, engineers, data analysts, or quants, but also less technical individuals with degrees in non-quantitative fields such as the social sciences or business. We expect that the reader will have had at least one elementary course in statistics."

I recommend ✅  this book because- 

1. It gives a modest introduction to statistics and mathematics behind the most used methods like:

- Regressions
- Classifications
- Decision Trees
- SVM
- Clustering
- Unsupervised Learning
- Resampling
- Cross-Validation Methods
- Dimension reduction methods

2. As mentioned before, a lab section with examples for different methods is given at the end of each chapter. It prepares you to understand the concepts and practise them with examples using R (A statistical programming language). This will help you get started and equip you to test out the given models on your own data. 

🌟**Highlight**: This repo gives the same code in python, so you are covered either way!


Few important concepts it does not touch at all are-

- Time series data models
- Neural networks
- Deep learning
- Bayesian

This is an independent part of my [blog series](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-science-for-analytical-minds-introduction-8900b8d2477f)curated especially for people from non-technical backgrounds like economics, statistics, mathematics, physics etc. 

Checkout its 👉 [introductory blog](https://medium.com/@Shilpa9a/statistical-machine-learning-in-python-b095d4af36dd) & [data quality & cleaning blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/dirty-data-quality-assessment-cleaning-measures-39efb90ad734). This is the 3rd part of the series focusing on statistics & ML basics.

This is meant to give you quick head start with most used statistical concepts with data and code to play with. For a deeper understanding of any concept, I recommend referring back to the book.
